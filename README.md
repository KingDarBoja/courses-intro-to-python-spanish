## Introduction to Python in Spanish: Introducción a Python

Spanish version of _Introduction to Python for Data Science_ on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science). Currently being translated by myself using the original repository available at [GitHub](https://github.com/datacamp/courses-intro-to-python). Feel free to contribute and help to grow the spanish community at Datacamp.

## Notes
1. The _subsetting_ translation was between _rebanar_ and _select_, but most times I choose the first one to avoid unnecessary redundancy like _selecciona de una lista para seleccionar_.
2. In the first exercises at chapter 3, the video mention the square bracket role when checking for documentation on a function as optional argument. But since there isn't a spanish video, I think there should be a extra exercise to explain this.
3. Since _array_ is described as a collection of values and such things (In chapter 4); Spanish language doesn't have an exact translation of it, because 2D arrays are called "matrices" while 1D ones are "vectores". The general translation of _array_ is "formación", but to avoid such confusion, I simply let _array_ without translation.
